# 🎭 LED Mask Project  

This is an **Arduino-powered LED mask** inspired by [BoyWithUke](https://boywithuke.com/) 🎶. It features animated **LED eyes** and a **smile**, activated using an **ultrasonic sensor**.

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- **Arduino Nano**  
- **5 LED Matrix Displays (8x8)**  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- **Jump Wires & Resistors**  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Dynamic LED eyes** 👀  
✅ **Animated smile** 😀  
✅ **Auto-activation with ultrasonic sensor** 🛑  
✅ **USB-powered** 🔌

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. The **LED_Matrix_Eyes2.ino** code controls the LED matrices for eye animations.  
2. The **LED_Matrix_Smile1.ino** handles the smile animation.  
3. The **ultrasonic sensor** detects when someone is near and **turns on/off the mask**.  

## 📜 Code  
- `LED_Matrix_Eyes2.ino` → Handles **eye movement**  
- `LED_Matrix_Smile1.ino` → Controls **smile animations**  

## 💡 Inspiration  
Inspired by **BoyWithUke**, an artist known for wearing a unique LED mask. This project brings his signature look to life using **Arduino and electronics**.
